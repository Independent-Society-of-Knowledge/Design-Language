# Open Collaboration
Open-Collaboration refers to any system that does innovation or production that relies on goal-oriented yet loosely coordinated participants who cooperate voluntarily to create a product of economic value, which is made freely available to contributors or non-contributors alike.

The organizing principle behind open-collaboration is that of peer production. Peer production communities are structured in an entirely decentralized manner, but differ from markets in that they function without price-based coordination, and often on the basis of volunteering only.

Such communities are geared toward the production of openly accessible public or "common" goods, but differ from the state as well as charity groups in that they operate without a formal hierarchical structure.

Traditional academic institutions are often characterized by physical campuses, and hierarchical structures. This means that having an open-collaboration method in academia is doomed to failure if it is to be implemented within the academia itself.

# As an Idea
We define **Independent Society of Knowledge**, to any society of scientific inquiry, that produces knowledge and researches on the basis of *Open-Collaboration*. This means that the society must be decentralized, without official hierarchy, and its result must be accessible for contributors and non-contributors.

These societies in our opinion are the necessary step towards a more free, accessible, natural, and efficient scientific communities. Along side the traditional academia, each ISK can presents goods to the community of science.

# Who are We?
**The Independent Society of Knowledge**, is the first actualization of an open-collaborative society in research and science. We are committed to build the infrastructure that is necessary for scientific community to become more decentralized, free, and collaborative. 

Because of our vision, the main activities of The Independent Society of Knowledge are:
1. **Platforms and Infrastructures** that would push scientific inquiry to a more free, accessible region
2. **Research and Development** of professional software in each field of science.
3. **Educational Programs** that would enhance students and teams journey towards scientific research.
4. **Public Outreach** for both The ISK and the ideology. And supporting other communities through their scientific inquiry.

# Our Brand
Our ideology, and work requires to be known by individuals and teams of scientific community. Our brand tries to embed these ideas, and be a modern, bold brand for such communities. 

We are The Independent Society of Knowledge.
